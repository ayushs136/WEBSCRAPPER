# web scraper
Hey Guys, i'm Krono$ , I just made an awesome webscrapper in python 3. 
this is a intermediate webscrapper with limited applications like
downloading images and searching products on flipkart.
there is a minor bug in the program so if anyone have some knowledge in python 3
can help me to remove the bug....
use pycharm for better interface....
hope you'll like it.
